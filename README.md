# Rolling-a-Dice

Arithmetic.
---------------------------------------------
Many games require players to roll dice. While Six sided dice are most common, other dice are also used. For instance games use 4 sided, 8 sided, 10 sided, 12, and 20 sided dice, just to name a few.

The number and sides of dice to roll are indicated using the notation `nDs` 
where `n` is the number of dice to roll, and `s` is the number of sides on each dice.

E.g. 4D6 means "Roll four six-sided dice". 
Similarly 1D20 requires the player to roll one 20-sided dice.

The "value" of a roll is the sum of all dice rolled. 
For example the value of 2D6 is the sum of individual values obtained by rolling two Six-sided dice.
The maximum in this case is 12 (both dice rolled a 6), while the minimum possible value is 2(both dice rolled a 1).

In some games, users are required to roll dice of different types and then add, subtract, or otherwise
manipulate the values.

For instance, 4D6 + 1D4 means "Add the value of a 4D6 roll to the value of a 1D4 roll". The
minimum and maximum values possible in this case are respectively 5, and 28.


Problem Statement : Design a command line utility to simulate dice arithmetic. Users should be able to enter simple arithmetic - only plus/minus signs, no parentheses - and see a random outcome. Support the following Dice only - 4 Sided, 6 Sided, 8 Sided, 10 Sided, 12 Sided, and 20 Sided.

For e.g.
$> diceRoller 4D6 + 3D4 # Valid, show a result.

$> diceRoller 4D6 + 3D25 # 25 Sided dice are
not supported, show an error message.

$> diceRoller 0D6 - 1D4 # 0 dice doesn't make sense,
show an error message.

$> diceRoller 3D8 - 2D4 # Valid, show a result.

$> diceRoller 3D8 - 2D4 + 4D6 # Valid, show a result.

$> diceRoller 4D11 + 3D4 # 11 Sided dice are not
supported, show an error message.

$> diceRoller 4D6+3D4 # Valid, spaces before/after
operators should be ignored.

$> diceRoller 4 D 6 + 3D4 # Invalid, no spaces allowed
in nDs notation.

$> diceRoller 4d6 + 3D4 # Valid, treat d and D the
same. Show result.

Each dice should be rolled randomly. 
Bonus points for working out a mechanism to test if the dice rolls are truly random
